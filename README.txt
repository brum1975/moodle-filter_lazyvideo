Description:
This is a text filter for Moodle that converts ClickView urls into embeded content.  The current text filter will only replace hyperlinks with the embeded content.  This only works for video short urls.

Installation:
Download the source files. (zip file is available under download section)
Unzip the package
Copy the "clickview" folder to moodle/filter on the Moodle server.
Login as an admin on the Moodle site and install the filter.

To use:
By default the clickview filter is enabled for all content.  You can change this under Plugins > Filters.

When inserting a Clickview link url into a discussion, create a hyperlink and insert the url as the target.  When the discussion is posted the url will be changed into the embed content.
